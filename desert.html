                &nbsp &nbsp &nbspDeserts cover about one fifth of the Earth's
                surface and occur where rainfall is less than 50 cm/year.
                Although most deserts, such as the Sahara of North Africa and
                the deserts of the southwestern U.S., Mexico, and Australia,
                occur at low latitudes, another kind of desert, cold deserts,
                occur in the basin and range area of Utah and Nevada and in
                parts of western Asia.<br />
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbspMost deserts have a considerable amount of
                specialized vegetation, as well as specialized vertebrate and
                invertebrate animals. Soils often have abundant nutrients
                because they need only water to become very productive and have
                little or no organic matter. Disturbances are common in the form
                of occasional fires or cold weather, and sudden, infrequent, but
                intense rains that cause flooding. There are relatively few
                large mammals in deserts because most are not capable of storing
                sufficient water and withstanding the heat. Deserts often
                provide little shelter from the sun for large animals. The
                dominant animals of warm deserts are nonmammalian vertebrates,
                such as reptiles. Mammals are usually small, like the kangaroo
                mice of North American deserts. Desert biomes can be classified
                according to several characteristics.

            <p>
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDeserts experience extreme shortages of
                water due to lack of precipitation. The primary characteristic
                of deserts is that they are dry. <br />
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDeserts are commonly defined as areas that
                receive less than 10 in (250 mm) of rain annually. There are
                records of deserts going without rain for hundreds of years, for
                example, the Atacama Desert in Chile. However, most deserts do
                receive rain, even if only for a few days each year. <br />
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDesert rainfall is usually unpredictable. As
                a result desert animals and plants cannot rely on the presence
                of moisture for their growing or reproductive seasons they must
                first wait for rain to arrive before completing their life
                cycles. In addition, rainfall in deserts often comes in
                downpours. This causes flooding before the water is lost into
                the sandy soil. <br />
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe air is dry in deserts, and clouds do not
                form; therefore, clear skies are also a characteristic of
                deserts. The cloudless skies allow much of the suns radiation to
                reach the ground, leading to very high daytime temperatures.
                Similarly, once the sun sets in a desert, the warmth is quickly
                radiated away into the atmosphere as there are no clouds to trap
                it. This causes very low temperatures at night. Desert plants
                and animals must be able to tolerate extremes of both heat and
                cold.<br />
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDeserts are also characterized by having
                plants that grow very slowly. The process of photosynthesis (in
                which plants use the suns energy to make food for growth)
                requires water. Because water is in short supply, plant
                production in deserts is the lowest of any biome on
                earth.Deserts have formed all over the world where moisture is
                scarce and unpredictable. The extent and cause of the aridity
                varies, and this means that no single definition fully describes
                the conditions in all deserts.<br />
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSubtropical deserts are very hot and dry.
                They occur at low latitudes, to the south and north of the
                equator. The dry conditions are caused by patterns of
                atmospheric circulation that start over equatorial regions.<br />
                &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTemperate deserts, also known as cold
                deserts, occur at higher latitudes and therefore have cooler
                temperatures. Their aridity is caused by being far from the
                ocean or from being close to high mountains that prevent moist
                air from reaching inland.
