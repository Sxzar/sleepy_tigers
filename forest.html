                        linked by transfer of energy and material, is called an

                    <h2>What is a forest ecosystem?</h2>
                    <hr />
                    <p>
                        A forest ecosystem is a functional unit or a
                        classification which includes birds, insects, trees,
                        animals, soil, and humans as its networking units. A
                        forest is a big and multifaceted ecosystem and therefore
                        has more species diversity. Furthermore, it is much more
                        unchanging and unaffected by the harmful alterations in
                        comparison to the smaller ecosystems like wetlands and
                        grasslands. Forest ecosystems, like any other ecosystem,
                        also consist of abiotic and biotic components. Abiotic
                        components are inorganic elements like air, soil and
                        water. Biotic components comprise of producers,
                        consumers, and decomposers. These components intermingle
                        with each other in an ecosystem and as a result, this
                        collaboration among them makes it self-sustainable.
                        These connections allow for very high sustainability
                        among forested ecosystems. These are often indicative of
                        forest health as well.

                    Introduction 17European forest ecosystemsForests host a
                    myriad of living organisms and contain a major assemblage of
                    terrestrial species. Forestecosystems provide a range of
                    ecosystem services that are vital to society and human
                    well-being (Thompson et al., 2014). A recent study conducted
                    by theEuropean Environment Agency (EEA) estimated that
                    around 60 % of Europeans live in, or close to, forests(EEA,
                    2015a). The immediate presence of forests allows the use of
                    forest-related services, especially non-marketed services
                    such as clean air, recreational use, and spiritual and
                    aesthetic values. Forests provide protection against soil
                    erosion, regulate local and global climates, enhance water
                    retention, facilitate pollination and improve landscape
                    aesthetics.Introduction 17European forest ecosystemsForests

                    Forests exist in all types of climate, whether dry, wet,
                    extremely cold or extremely hot. The beauty of forest
                    ecosystems lies in their diversity. According to their
                    distance from the equator, they can be classified into three
                    major types – tropical forest ecosystem, temperate forest
                    ecosystem and boreal forest ecosystem.

                        <p>
                            The Tropical forests mainly exist around the equator
                            in places like South America, Africa, Amazon region,
                            and Southeast Asia. They have the maximum species
                            diversity per area in the world. Here, it rains a
                            lot throughout the year but the temperature remains
                            stable around 27°C. Generally, these forests have
                            two seasons, namely rainy and dry. The temperature,
                            rainfall and twelve hours of daylight stimulate the
                            growth of up to 100 different species of trees. Some
                            of them are broadleaf trees, mosses, ferns, palms,
                            and orchids. These trees grow very densely and block
                            most of the light from penetrating into it. One can
                            also find animals such as snakes, frogs, lizards,
                            monkeys, anacondas, jaguars, and small mammals in
                            these forests. Due to nutrient leaching, the soil of
                            these forests lacks maximum essential nutrients
                            which in turn make it useless for agriculture only
                            after a few years of use. Thus, the topsoil gets
                            depleted soon.

                        <p>
                            We can find temperate forests in North America,
                            northeastern Asia, and Europe. In these forests,
                            there are four seasons. Generally, the temperature
                            here ranges from -30 to 30°C. These forests receive
                            rainfall of around 75-150cm. Usually, one can find
                            only 3-4 species of trees on an average per square
                            km. Deciduous or leaf shedding trees form a large
                            proportion of trees. Coniferous trees such as pines
                            and firs also grow here. Some of the common trees
                            are oak, beech, elm, maple, birch, willow, and
                            hickory. Some of the commonly found animals are
                            rabbits, birds, squirrels, deer, wolves, foxes, and
                            bears. Both, the plants and the animals are adaptive
                            to the cold winters and warm summer weather. The
                            soil of these forests is fertile due to the
                            combination of decaying fallen leaves and the
                            moderate temperatures.

                            Usually, we can find them between 50 to 60 degrees
                            of latitude in the sub-Arctic zone which comprises
                            of Siberia, Scandinavia, Alaska, and Canada. These
                            have two seasons namely, a short, moist and
                            mildly-warm summer and a long, cold and dry winter.
                            The temperature here ranges from -40 to 20°C. One
                            can find evergreen conifers here with needle leaves
                            that are capable to stand the cold, such as pine,
                            fir, and spruce trees. Some of the animals that live
                            here are deer, wolverines, caribou, bats, small
                            mammals, birds, moose, bears, lynx, wolf, etc. that
                            can bear long and cold winters. These animals
                            usually have thick fur or other insulation. However,
                            the soil has a very thin layer and is poor in
                            nutrients and acidic. Also, the canopy here does not
                            allow the sunlight to penetrate into the ground and
                            thus there is very little growth of the understory.

                        Forest ecosystems are a critical component of the
                        world’s biodiversity as many forest are more biodiverse
                        than other ecosystems. The area covered by forests is
                        thus one of the indicators of Sustainable Development
                        Goal 15 “Life on land”. According to FRA 2020, forests
                        currently cover 30.8 percent of the global land area
                        (FAO, 2020). The total forest area is 4.06 billion
                        hectares, or approximately 0.5 ha per person, but
                        forests are not equally distributed around the globe.
                        More than half of the world’s forests are found in only
                        five countries (the Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada,
                        the United States of America and China) and two-thirds
                        (66 percent) of forests are found in ten countries

                        Forest area as a proportion of total land area, which
                        serves as SDG Indicator, decreased from 32.5 percent to
                        30.8 percent in the three decades between 1990 and 2020.
                        This represents a net loss of 178 million hectares of
                        forest, an area about the size of Libya. However, the
                        average rate of net forest loss declined by roughly 40
                        percent between 1990–2000 and 2010–2020 (from 7.84
                        million hectares per year to 4.74 million hectares per
                        year), the result of reduced forest area loss in some
                        countries and forest gains in others (Table 1) (FAO,
                        2020).

                        is primarily caused by agricultural expansion, while an
                        increase in forest area may occur through natural
                        expansion of forests, e.g. on abandoned agricultural
                        land, or through reforestation (including through
                        assisted natural regeneration) or afforestation.

                    Deforestation affects animals in many ways. It causes

                    food availability, and much more. As a result, some animals

                <p>
                    Deforestation is the total removal of trees or other
                    vegetation from land. It can be caused by human activity
                    such as logging or agriculture, but also natural disasters
                    like forest fires. It has a negative impact on many species
                    because it causes habitat fragmentation and loss. But that’s
                    not all. Animals are equally affected by forest
                    fragmentation and/or forest degradation. Forest
                    fragmentation is the reduction in the size of an intact
                    forest area, or the development of gaps in a formerly
                    contiguous forest. This means less space to live in, more
                    competition, and higher risks of disease transmission. On
                    top of that, they may have trouble finding enough food due
                    to changes in plant composition and distribution. Forest
                    degradation occurs when forests are damaged or destroyed in
                    ways that reduce their ability to provide ecosystem
                    services. This process leads to changes in soil structure,
                    water flow patterns, plant communities, wildlife
                    populations, and more. These changes also have serious
                    consequences for animal survival.

                            declining for centuries now for a variety of
                            reasons. Their favourite habitat is in conifer
                            woodland, or at least mixed woodlands. Changes in
                            the climate has meant that the pine forests have
                            retreated north where the climates are still cooler,
                            leaving these areas the best places to find Red

                            It likes roaming at night and climbing trees to
                            pester monkeys and birds. But unlike many cats, the

                            It’s believed that their habitat, diet, and
